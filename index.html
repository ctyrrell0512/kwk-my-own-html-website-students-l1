    <h4>Silver Creek High School</h4>
    <p>I attend Silver Creek High School (SCHS) in Longmont, CO which is a part of the St. Vrian Valley School District. The school is an average sized for Colorado with 1,241 students enrolled. The school offers regular, honors, and AP classes. There is also a unique program called Silver Creek Leadership Academy (SCLA). This program is a class all four years which works to prepare students later on in life as well as better the community. In athletics, SCHS competes in Class 4A. For the school I play basketball, soccer, and throw for track & feld. Silver Creek also has a great arts program with choir, orchestra, band, and theater.</p>
